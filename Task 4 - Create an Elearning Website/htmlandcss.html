        <h1>Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML)</h1>
        <p> <strong><u>HTML</u> :-</strong>
            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating a webpage. In easier words, HTML is a kind of programming language that can make a new webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly. HTML also adds meta information to a webpage. Meta information is usually not shown by web browsers and is data about the web page, e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style HTML elements while JavaScript is used for website behavior and also changing the HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p> <strong><u>Tags</u> :-</strong>
            HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: <example>. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many different kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. See Basic HTML Tags below for tag examples.
            Some tags only work in certain browsers. For example, the <menuitem> tag, which is used to make something appear when the person presses the right button of the mouse, only works on the Mozilla Firefox browser. Other browsers simply ignore this tag and display the writing normally. Many web page creators avoid using these "non-standard" tags because they want their pages to look the same with all browsers.
        </p>

        <p> <strong><u>Formatting Tags</u> :-</strong>
            In HTML, a number of elements are used to format text. The formatting tags are divided into two groups: physical tags, that are used to style the text (visual appearance of the text) and logical or semantic tags that add semantic value to the text parts (e. g., inform search engines for which keywords a web page should be ranked).
            <br>
            Here is the some examples of formatting tags in details.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; Tags.</strong>
            <br>
            The &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; tags are used to define HTML headings. There are 6 levels of headings in HTML, the &lt;h1&gt; defines the most and the &lt;h6&gt; least important headings.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; Tags.</strong>
            <br>
            The &lt;b&gt; tag is a physical tag that stands for <b>bold text</b> , whereas the &lt;strong&gt; tag being a logical tag is used to <strong>emphasize</strong> the importance of the text.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Tags.</strong>
            <br>
            The &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags define italic text. The &lt;i&gt; tag is only responsible for <i> <u>visual appearance</u> </i> of the enclosed text, without any extra importance. The &lt;em&gt;tag defines <em> <u>emphasized</u> </em> text, with added semantic importance.
        </p>

        <p> <strong><u>Empty Tag's</u> :-</strong>
            These are the tags that only have to start tag but do not have any closing tag. There are many tags which are called empty tags.
            <br>
            For Example:-
            <br>
            1.&lt;img&gt; tag: -This tag is used to insert images on the web page. This tag is empty and it doesn’t have any closing tags of its own.
            <br>
            code :- &lt;img src="XYZimage.jpeg"&gt;
            so you will see an image has been inserted in the web page.
            <br>
            2. &lt;hr&gt; tag:- This is the tag which is used to draw a horizontal line in the web page .it is basically used for separating the content in the web page.
            <br>
            code : &lt;hr&gt;
        </p>

        <p> <strong><u>HyperLink</u> :-</strong>
            Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web.Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address.
        </p>

        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</h1>
        <p> <strong><u>CSS</u> :-</strong>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as 
            HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        </p>

        <p> <strong> <u>Different Variations of CSS</u></strong>
            There are three ways you can use to implement CSS: internal, external, and inline styles. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>01)Internal CSS</strong><br>
            Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML document.This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However, using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put CSS rules to every page of your website.
            <br>

            <strong>02)External CSS</strong><br>
            With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device (e.g., Notepad++).
            This CSS type is a more efficient method,especially for styling a large website.By editing one .css file,you can change your entire site at once.
            <br>

            <strong>03)Inline CSS</strong>
            <br>
            Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.
            This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually. Managing your website may become too hard if you only use inline CSS.
            However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where you don’t have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only.
        </p>

        <p><strong><u>Advantages of CSS</u> :-</strong>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web design tool used to control the layout of a webpage while HTML deals with the actual content. There are different versions of CSS including the kind that is found in the actual HTML code itself, but that defeats the purpose of using CSS in the first place. For better performance and easier maintenance, a separate CSS file is preferred over embedded CSS. If font, text size, or changes in the appearance of any element are to be made later, simply accessing a separate CSS file is much easier than having to go through extensive lines of code in an HTML file.
            CSS has gone through several changes over the years, and the latest version is CSS3. Most web browsers likely support the CSS3 standard. With this latest version, CSS designers have more tools at their disposal.
        </p>

        <p><strong><u>CSS Frameworks</u> :-</strong>
            A CSS framework is a library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns. This detail differentiates CSS frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.<br>
            Two notable and widely used examples are Bootstrap and Foundation.
        </p>

        <p><p><strong><u>Universal selectors</u> :-</strong>
            An asterisk (*) is the universal selector for CSS. It matches a single element of any type.
            <br>
            *|* - matches all elements. <br>
            |* - matches all elements without any declared namespace.
